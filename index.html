 <h6><p><font face="arial" color="white">Robotics is the branch of science and engineering that focuses on designing, building, and programming robots. A robot is a machine that can perform tasks automatically, either by following pre-programmed instructions or by sensing and responding to its environment.<br>Robots come in many shapes and sizes — from tiny medical robots that help doctors during surgeries, to huge industrial robots that build cars, to drones that fly in the sky. Some robots can even think and make decisions using artificial intelligence!<br>The field of robotics combines many areas like mechanics (how things move), electronics (how robots are powered and controlled), and computer programming (telling robots what to do). People use robots to make life easier, safer, and more fun. For example, they can explore dangerous places, do repetitive tasks, or even entertain us in games and movies.<br>In short, robotics is like giving life to machines, letting them act, work, and sometimes even “think” in the way we humans do.</font></p></h6>

<h6><p><font face="arial" color="white">The first real modern robot was Unimate, invented by George Devol in 1954. Unlike earlier mechanical devices and automata, Unimate was a true programmable machine designed to perform industrial tasks. It marked the beginning of robotics as we know it today.<br>Unimate was built as a robotic arm that could handle dangerous and repetitive jobs in factories. Its main function was to pick up hot metal pieces and stack them safely, a task that was both tiring and hazardous for human workers. By 1961, the first Unimate was installed at a General Motors plant in New Jersey, where it became the first robot to be used in mass production.<br>This invention revolutionized manufacturing by showing that robots could work alongside humans to improve safety, efficiency, and productivity. Unimate’s success paved the way for the development of modern industrial robots and set the foundation for the robotic technology we see in factories, hospitals, and even homes today.</font></p></h6>
